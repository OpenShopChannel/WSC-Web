This could potentially be a server for the Open Shop Channel.

## What is the Open Shop Channel?
The Open Shop Channel was originally going to be a replacement to the Wii Shop Channel, but since it got wayyyyyyy too hard the developers decided to forget it
temporarily, and they forked the Homebrew Browser which was way out of date, and put updated software on it.

This and the `ShopChannel` repo are the closest they really got publicly.

## Needs
- support for downloading
- improved look
- testers!

## Wants
- themes, like "classic", "default", "dark", etc
- nice touches like the 8-bit mario
